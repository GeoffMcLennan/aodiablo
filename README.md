# Gheeds Gambit

Gamble with Gheed here: https://gheeds-gambit.aodhagan.xyz/

Welcome! This is a small side project I created while waiting for Diablo II Resurrected patch 2.4 to drop. It's a little tool that facilitates a fully random run of Diablo 2, each time you level up in game you can use the tool to "roll the dice" on how you should spend your attribute and skill points. It factors in your characters current level and prerequisite skills so don't worry about not being able to spend your points!

## Task Backlog (by approximate priority)

1. Support classes other than Amazon (I really hate data entry...)
2. Support skill quests and attribute quests
3. Persist state/multiple states, and make it shareable (so you don't lose your progress if you close the tab)
4. Make it less ugly (I also hate CSS)
4. Support undoing a roll (in case you make a mistake, not just because you don't like the roll ðŸ˜‡)
